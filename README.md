# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe React application. It allows two players (player "X" and player "O") to endulge in a simple yet highly competitive game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Features
A unique feature implemented is "time-travel" allowing the user to go back to any previous move in the game.

## Technology Used
This application was build with fundamental React skills using Hooks, state, components, etc. within VSCode.

## Current App

## Future Upgrades
In the future, I want to add improvements such as:

1. For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
2. Rewrite `Board` to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
3. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
4. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
5. Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.

As listed in the React tutorial. Alongside these improvements, I also want to add an AI element and give users the option to play against a computer.
